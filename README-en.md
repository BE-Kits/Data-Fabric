I wanted to build highly scalable fault tolerant systems made up of simple services that were maintainable, malleable, withstood the test of time, and importantly — were easy for humans to understand.

I wanted my services to be easily testable, and I didn’t want have to think about how they ran in production.

I wanted myself and my teammates to be able to deliver high quality code quickly. When code is delivered more quickly, that means your business can experiment more quickly, and therefore, find winning ideas more quickly.
